    Character Strings: Text data is stored as character strings, which can be plain text or alphanumeric. These strings can vary in length and are used in databases, spreadsheets, and programming languages.
    Numeric Data in Strings: Numeric data stored in a string format cannot be used for mathematical operations. For instance, U.S. zip codes should be stored as text to preserve leading zeros.
    Encoding Text: Text data is encoded using standard codes like ASCII for English and Unicode for other languages, allowing computers to represent text in numeric form.
