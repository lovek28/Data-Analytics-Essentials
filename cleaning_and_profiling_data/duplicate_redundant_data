Duplicate Data:

    Definition: Duplicate rows are identical entries that appear more than once in your dataset.
    Investigation Needed: Not all duplicates are errors. For example, two people might share the same name, or a customer might place the same order twice.
    Action: Investigate the reason for duplicates before deciding to remove them.

Removing Duplicates:

    Exact Duplicates: If rows are completely identical, you can use functions like unique in R to remove the extra copies.
    Slight Differences: If rows are not 100% identical, you'll need to manually review and decide which ones to keep.

Handling Redundant Data:

    Definition: Redundant data are rows that are not exact duplicates but contain similar or unnecessary information.
    Example: Two rows for Antarctica with different population numbers.
    Action: Use common sense and functions like filter in R to keep the most accurate data (e.g., the row with the more reasonable population number).

Simplified Steps:

    Identify: Look for duplicate or redundant rows in your dataset.
    Investigate: Determine why these duplicates or redundancies exist.
    Remove: Use appropriate functions or manual review to clean your data.
