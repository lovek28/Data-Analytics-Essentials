"Assessing and adapting the data for transformation":

    Data Profiling: Profiling data helps you understand the characteristics of your data set, such as record counts, totals, and averages. This is crucial for validating numbers and planning data cleaning.
    Validation: Knowing the totals and averages helps identify anomalies and validate your data later.
    Data Cleaning: Profiling informs the data cleaning process by highlighting issues like incorrect formats or unnecessary timestamps.
