Outliers:

    Definition: Outliers are data points that are significantly different from the rest of the data.
    Example: If you have temperature data from New York and one reading shows 212 degrees Fahrenheit, that's an outlier because it's unusually high.

Causes of Outliers:

    Errors: Outliers can be caused by mistakes, such as incorrect measurements or data entry errors.
        Example: The 212-degree reading might be due to a broken thermometer or someone writing down the wrong number.

    True Values: Sometimes, outliers are real and valid data points.

        Example: A CEO taking a $1 salary is an outlier but is still a true value.

Identifying Outliers:

    Scatterplots: These are graphs that show individual data points. Outliers will stand out as points far away from the rest.
    Histograms: These group data into ranges and show how many data points fall into each range. Outliers will appear in ranges with very few data points. 
    Boxplots: These show the distribution of data and highlight outliers. The "box" represents the middle 50% of the data, and "whiskers" extend to the rest of the data. Points outside the whiskers are outliers.


Inter-Quartile Range (IQR):

    Definition: The IQR measures the spread of the middle 50% of your data.
    Calculation:
        First Quartile (Q1): The 25th percentile of your data.
        Third Quartile (Q3): The 75th percentile of your data.
        IQR: Subtract Q1 from Q3 (IQR = Q3 - Q1).


Example: If Q1 is 18 and Q3 is 68, then IQR = 68 - 18 = 50.
Use in Boxplots: The "whiskers" of the boxplot extend to 1.5 times the IQR from Q1 and Q3. Points outside this range are considered outliers. 

Handling Outliers:

    Investigate: Determine if the outlier is an error or a valid data point.

        Example: Check if the 212-degree reading was a mistake or if the thermometer was placed in an unusual location.

 Remove Errors: If the outlier is due to an error, remove it from your dataset.

    Example: Delete the 212-degree reading if you confirm it's a mistake.


Keep True Values: If the outlier is a valid data point, keep it in your dataset.

    Example: Keep the $1 salary data point if it's accurate.
