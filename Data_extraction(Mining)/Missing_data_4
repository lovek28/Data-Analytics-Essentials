Types of Missing Data:

    MCAR (Missing Completely at Random):

        What it is: Data is missing for no specific reason.
        Example: Imagine you lose the last 100 rows of a randomly sorted spreadsheet. There's no pattern to why those rows are missing.
        Impact: Usually, you can ignore this type because it doesn't affect your analysis.

MAR (Missing at Random):

    What it is: Data is missing due to some pattern, but the pattern is explained by other data in your dataset.
    Example: If older people are less likely to respond to a survey, but you have their ages recorded, this is MAR.
    Impact: Often, you can still analyze your data accurately.

MNAR (Missing Not at Random):

    What it is: Data is missing due to a specific reason related to the data itself.
    Example: If a blood pressure meter can't read values above 180, and those high values are missing, this is MNAR.
    Impact: This is serious because it can bias your results.

Handling Missing Data:

    Analyze Other Data: Sometimes, you can figure out the missing values by looking at other data points.
    Interpolate: Estimate the missing values based on other observations.
    Ignore: In some cases, you might choose to ignore the missing data, especially if it's MCAR or MAR.
