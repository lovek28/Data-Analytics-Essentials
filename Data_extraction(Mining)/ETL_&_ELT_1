ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)

    Extract: This is the first step where data is taken from various source systems (like transactional databases). The data is moved to a staging area in a flat file format, making it easier to handle.
    Transform: Here, the data is reshaped and converted from its original format (used in transactional databases) to a format suitable for analysis (used in data warehouses). This transformation can involve cleaning, filtering, and structuring the data. 
    Load: Finally, the transformed data is loaded into a data warehouse where it can be accessed and analyzed.


ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)

    Extract: Similar to ETL, data is extracted from source systems.
    Load: Instead of transforming the data in a staging area, it is directly loaded into the data warehouse. 
    Transform: The transformation happens within the data warehouse using SQL. This method can be more efficient for large datasets as it leverages the processing power of the database.

Key Differences

    Transformation Location: In ETL, transformation happens outside the database (often using programming languages like Python). In ELT, it happens inside the database using SQL.
    Initial Load: The first time data is loaded into a data warehouse, it's called an initial load. This can be time-consuming as it involves moving all historical data.
    Delta Loads: To keep the data warehouse updated, smaller, incremental updates called delta loads are performed regularly (e.g., weekly, daily, or hourly).
