Sorting data involves reordering rows in a dataset based on specified criteria, such as ascending or descending order for numeric or text values.

Filtering data involves selecting rows in a dataset that meet specific criteria to focus on relevant information.

Aggregate Functions: These functions summarize data across a dataset. The main functions discussed are:

    count: Counts the number of rows.
    sum: Calculates the total of an expression.
    min: Finds the minimum value.
    max: Finds the maximum value.
    average (or mean): Finds the average value.

Recoding data allows for changing the values of a categorical variable based on specific criteria, such as transforming salary values into salary ranges.
      Recoding data means changing the values of a variable based on certain rules. For example, instead of showing exact salaries, you can group them into categories like "low," "medium," and "high." If an employee earns $50,000, you can recode it to "low"; if they earn $60,000, recode it to "medium"; and if they earn $80,000, recode it to "high." This way, you simplify the data without revealing exact numbers.


Data transposition is the process of swapping the rows and columns in a dataset. This means that the values originally in rows are moved to columns, and the values in columns are moved to rows.


Why Use Data Transposition?

    Sometimes, the way data is initially structured may not be the most useful for analysis. Transposing data can make it easier to work with and analyze.

Imagine you have a table showing the number of visitors to three websites over the first five months of the year. Initially, you have:

| Website | Jan | Feb | Mar | Apr | May |
|---------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Site A | 100 | 150 | 200 | 250 | 300 |
| Site B | 110 | 160 | 210 | 260 | 310 |
| Site C | 120 | 170 | 220 | 270 | 320 |

After transposing, the table would look like this:

| Month | Site A | Site B | Site C |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| Jan | 100 | 110 | 120 |
| Feb | 150 | 160 | 170 |
| Mar | 200 | 210 | 220 |
| Apr | 250 | 260 | 270 |
| May | 300 | 310 | 320 |


Normalization removes units from measurements, putting data on a consistent scale for easier comparison.
Min-Max Normalization: This method scales data to a range of 0 to 1 by setting the smallest value to 0 and the largest to 1, with all other values adjusted proportionally.
