    Purpose of Data Definitions:

        Consistency: Data definitions ensure that everyone in the organization has a shared understanding of key terms, which is crucial for maintaining consistent data.
        Clarity: Clear definitions help avoid misunderstandings and errors in data interpretation.

    Creating Data Definitions:

        Collaborative Effort: Involve all relevant stakeholders to gather input and avoid future disagreements.
        Common Elements: Each definition should include:
            The term being defined.
            A clear, concise description understandable to business users.
            Any technical details, such as the source of truth for the data.
            Possible values for categorical data.
            Identity of the data owner or steward.


    Data Dictionary:

        Centralized Reference: The collection of all data definitions forms a data dictionary, which serves as a centralized reference for business analysts, technologists, and other stakeholders.
        Avoid Overlapping Definitions: Ensure that definitions are unique and standardized across the organization to prevent confusion.


Summary
Developing solid data definitions is essential for maintaining data quality and consistency. In your role, having clear definitions helps ensure that data analysis is accurate and aligned with the organization's standards.
