Data Stewardship Responsibilities

    Data Quality:

        Ensuring Accuracy and Relevance: Data stewards make sure the data is correct and useful for the organization's needs.
        Consistency and Completeness: They monitor data to ensure it is consistent across the organization and complete, meaning no important data is missing.
        Ongoing Validation: Regular checks are performed to maintain data quality over time. 
        Promoting Data Reuse: Encouraging the use of existing data for new purposes to avoid duplication.

     Data Security:

        Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability: Protecting data from unauthorized access (confidentiality), ensuring it is accurate and reliable (integrity), and making sure it is accessible when needed (availability).
        Access Control: Deciding who can access the data and under what conditions.
        Data Use Agreements: Determining when to enter agreements with third parties for data use.
        Release Approvals: Granting permissions to share data both internally and externally.

    Data Privacy:

        Respecting Data Subjects: Ensuring the organization respects the rights and wishes of individuals whose data is collected.
        Separate from Security: While related to security, privacy focuses specifically on the rights of individuals.

    Regulatory Compliance:

        Meeting Legal Obligations: Ensuring the organization complies with various laws and regulations related to data protection.
        Understanding Obligations: Knowing the specific legal requirements based on the organization's nature, the data it collects, and where it operates.
