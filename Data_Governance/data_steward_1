Data stewardship involves managing and taking care of an organization's data. Here's a simplified breakdown:

    Collaboration Across Teams: Data stewardship requires different departments to work together. For example, in your field, human resources, IT, legal, and data analytics teams all play roles in managing employee data.
    Data Owner: A senior leader, like a VP of HR, is typically designated as the data owner. They have ultimate authority over the data but delegate day-to-day responsibilities.
    Data Stewards: These are individuals appointed by the data owner to handle daily data management tasks. They ensure data is collected, preserved, secured, and maintained properly.


In essence, data stewards act as caretakers of data, ensuring it is accurate, secure, and used appropriately across the organization.
