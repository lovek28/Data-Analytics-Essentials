Variance

    Definition: Variance measures how much the values in a dataset differ from the mean (average) of the dataset.
    How to Calculate:
        Find the mean (average) of the dataset.
        Subtract the mean from each value to get the deviation for each value.
        Square each deviation to make them positive.
        Sum all the squared deviations. 
        Divide by the number of values (for population variance) or by the number of values minus one (for sample variance).

Standard Deviation

    Definition: Standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It provides a measure of the average distance of each value from the mean.
    How to Calculate:
        Take the square root of the variance.

    Example: If the variance of the heights is 11.6 (population variance), the standard deviation would be the square root of 11.6, which is approximately 3.4.

Key Points:

    Population vs. Sample:
        Population Variance: Uses all data points in the dataset.
        Sample Variance: Uses a subset of the data and divides by the number of values minus one.

    Symbols:
        Population Variance: σ²
        Sample Variance: s²
        Population Standard Deviation: σ
        Sample Standard Deviation: s

Application in Data Analysis

    Variance: Helps you understand the spread of your data. A higher variance means more spread out values.
    Standard Deviation: Provides a more intuitive measure of spread, as it is in the same units as the data.
