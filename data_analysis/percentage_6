A percentage is a way to express a number as a fraction of 100. The term "percent" literally means "per hundred."

Key Points:

    Percent Change: Used to measure how much a value has increased or decreased over time.
    Percent Difference: Used to compare the relative difference between two values.
        Formula = | (1st - 2nd)/((1st+2nd)/2)|*100 (| | -> means absolute value (i.e. only positive value)

  Example: If you have 5 dogs and your friend has 3 dogs, the percent difference is:
        |(5-3)/((5+3)/2)|*100 = 50%

Application in Data Analysis:

    Percentages: Useful for normalizing data, making it easier to compare different datasets.
    Percent Change: Helps track growth or decline in metrics like sales, population, or performance.
    Percent Difference: Useful for comparing metrics between different groups or time periods.
