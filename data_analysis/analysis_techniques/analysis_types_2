    Trend Analysis:

        Objective: Identify patterns by comparing data over time.
        Details: This involves examining data points collected at different times to determine if there are any consistent trends. For example, if you work for a hospitality company, you might look at the total sales for each state over the past five years. By doing this, you can identify whether sales are declining, remaining consistent, or growing in each state. This helps in making decisions like selling unprofitable properties or investing in areas showing growth.

    Performance Analysis:

        Objective: Measure performance against defined goals.
        Details: This analysis examines whether specific goals are being met. For instance, a hospitality company might have average occupancy goals for each property. Performance analysis can identify whether properties are achieving these goals. Combining this with trend analysis can help in developing future projections and making informed decisions.

    Link Analysis:

        Objective: Explore relationships between data points using network theory.
        Details: This technique is used to understand patterns in the connections between individual observations. For example, in the case of the Panama Papers data leak, journalists used link analysis to uncover patterns of financial activities like tax evasion and money laundering. This involves mapping out relationships and connections between different entities to identify significant patterns.


These analyses help in understanding different aspects of data and making informed decisions based on the insights gained. Given your background in data analysis, these techniques will be valuable in your work.
