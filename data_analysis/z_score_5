A Z-score indicates how many standard deviations a particular value is from the mean of the dataset.

Calculation:

    Find the Mean: Calculate the average of your dataset.
    Subtract the Mean: For each value, subtract the mean to find the deviation from the mean.
    Divide by Standard Deviation: Divide this deviation by the standard deviation of the dataset.

Example:

    Mean height = 32.7 inches
    Standard deviation = 3.4
    For a height of 38 inches:
    Z-score = (38 - 32.7)/3.4
        This means the height of 38 inches is 1.56 standard deviations above the mean.

Interpretation:

    Z-scores and Normal Distribution:
        68.2% of data lies within ±1 standard deviation (Z-scores between -1 and 1).
        95.4% of data lies within ±2 standard deviations (Z-scores between -2 and 2).
        99.7% of data lies within ±3 standard deviations (Z-scores between -3 and 3).

Usage in Data Analysis:

    Identify Outliers: Values with Z-scores beyond ±3 are potential outliers.
    Standardize Data: Z-scores allow comparison of values from different datasets.
