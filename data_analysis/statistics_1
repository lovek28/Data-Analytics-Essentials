Statistics is the practice of applying mathematical techniques to data to help analyze, interpret, and present it. There are two main branches of statistics:

Descriptive Statistics:

    Purpose: Focuses on summarizing and describing the visible features of a dataset.
    Techniques: Includes measures like mean (average), median (middle value), mode (most frequent value), range (difference between highest and lowest values), and standard deviation (how spread out the values are).
    Usage: Helps you understand the basic characteristics of your data, such as the central tendency and variability.

Inferential Statistics:

    Purpose: Goes beyond description to make generalized conclusions and predictions about a larger population based on a sample of data.
    Techniques: Includes hypothesis testing (determining if there is enough evidence to support a specific claim), confidence intervals (range within which a population parameter is expected to lie), and regression analysis (examining relationships between variables). 
    Usage: Allows you to make predictions and infer trends from your data, which is crucial for data-driven decision-making.


    Descriptive Statistics to summarize student performance data, like average grades or attendance rates.
    Inferential Statistics to predict future trends, such as student enrollment numbers or the effectiveness of new teaching methods.
