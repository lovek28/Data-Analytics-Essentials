What is Correlation?

    Correlation: A statistical measure that describes how two variables move in relation to each other.

Types of Correlation

    Positive Correlation:

        When one variable increases, the other variable also increases.
        Example: Height and shoe size. Taller people generally have larger shoe sizes.

    Negative Correlation:

        When one variable increases, the other variable decreases.
        Example: Number of classes missed and exam grades. More absences usually lead to lower exam grades.

  No Correlation:

    No relationship between the variables.
    Example: A student's height and their exam performance.

Visualizing Correlation

    Graphs:
        Upward Line: Positive correlation.
        Downward Line: Negative correlation.
        No Trend: No correlation.


Correlation Coefficient (r)

    Range: -1 to +1
        +1: Perfect positive correlation.
        -1: Perfect negative correlation.
        0: No correlation.

Important Note

    Correlation Does Not Imply Causation:
        Just because two variables are correlated does not mean one causes the other.
        Example: Sunburns and ice cream consumption. Both increase on hot days, but eating ice cream doesn't cause sunburns.

Understanding these concepts will help you analyze relationships between variables in your data analysis work.
