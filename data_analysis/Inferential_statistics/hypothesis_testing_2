Hypothesis Testing in Simple Terms

    Hypothesis:

        Alternative Hypothesis ((H_a)): This is what you want to prove (e.g., a new drug works).
        Null Hypothesis ((H_0)): This is the opposite of what you want to prove (e.g., the new drug does not work).

Significance Level ((alpha)):

    This is the risk you're willing to take of being wrong when you reject (H_0). Common choices are 5% (0.05) or 1% (0.01).


P-Value:

    This tells you how likely it is that your results happened by chance. A small P-value means your results are likely not due to chance.

What is a P-value?

    P-value: The probability that the observed results are due to random chance, assuming the null hypothesis ((H_0)) is true.


How to Interpret P-value:

    Small P-value (â‰¤ (\alpha)): Indicates strong evidence against (H_0), so you reject (H_0).
    Large P-value (> (\alpha)): Indicates weak evidence against (H_0), so you fail to reject (H_0).

Example in Simple Terms:
Imagine you're testing a new drug to see if it works better than a placebo.

    Null Hypothesis ((H_0)): The drug has no effect.
    Alternative Hypothesis ((H_a)): The drug has an effect.

You conduct an experiment and calculate the P-value.

    If P-value = 0.02: There's a 2% chance that the observed effect is due to random chance. Since 0.02 is less than the common significance level of 0.05, you reject (H_0) and conclude the drug likely works.
    If P-value = 0.10: There's a 10% chance that the observed effect is due to random chance. Since 0.10 is greater than 0.05, you fail to reject (H_0) and conclude there's not enough evidence to say the drug works.


Key Takeaway:

    A smaller P-value means stronger evidence against the null hypothesis, suggesting the results are significant and not due to random chance.



Steps in Hypothesis Testing

    Formulate Hypotheses:

        Decide what you want to prove ((H_a)) and what the opposite is ((H_0)).
        Example: (H_a): The drug works. (H_0): The drug does not work.

 Choose Significance Level ((\alpha)):

    Decide how much risk of being wrong you can accept. Often, this is 0.05 (5%).


Collect Data:

    Gather data by doing experiments, surveys, or observations.

 Calculate P-Value:

    Use statistical tests to get the P-value from your data.


Compare P-Value and (\alpha):

    If the P-value is less than or equal to (\alpha), reject (H_0) (meaning your results are significant).
    If the P-value is greater than (\alpha), do not reject (H_0) (meaning your results are not significant).

Example

    Scenario: Testing a new drug.
    (H_a): The drug works.
    (H_0): The drug does not work.
    Significance Level: (\alpha = 0.05) (5% risk of being wrong).
    P-Value: Suppose it is 0.02.
        Since 0.02 < 0.05, you reject (H_0) and conclude the drug works.

Types of Errors

    Type I Error: You think the drug works when it actually doesn't (false positive).
    Type II Error: You think the drug doesn't work when it actually does (false negative).


In your field, understanding this process helps you make data-driven decisions by determining if your findings are significant or just due to random chance.
