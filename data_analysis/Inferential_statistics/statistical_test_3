T-Test

    Purpose: To determine if there is a statistically significant difference between the means of two groups.
    When to Use: When your data is numeric and you want to compare the means of two groups.
    Example: Testing if a drug raises a blood test score significantly.
        Null Hypothesis ((H_0)): The drug has no effect (mean scores are the same).
        Alternative Hypothesis ((H_a)): The drug has an effect (mean scores are different).
        P-Value: If the P-value is small (e.g., less than 0.05), you reject (H_0) and conclude the drug has an effect.


Chi-Square Test

    Purpose: To determine if there is an association between two categorical variables.
    When to Use: When your data is categorical (not numeric) and you want to see if two variables are related.
    Example: Checking if the type of high school (public or private) is related to college honors performance (no honors, honors, high honors).
        Null Hypothesis ((H_0)): No association between high school type and honors performance.
        Alternative Hypothesis ((H_a)): There is an association between high school type and honors performance.
        P-Value: If the P-value is small (e.g., less than 0.05), you reject (H_0) and conclude there is an association.


Key Takeaways

    T-Test: Use for numeric data to compare means of two groups.
    Chi-Square Test: Use for categorical data to check for associations between variables.


In your field, understanding these tests can help you analyze data more effectively, making data-driven decisions and insights.
