Linear regression is a method used to predict the value of one variable based on the value of another variable.

Linear Regression Model:

    Purpose: To find the best-fitting straight line through the data points that shows the relationship between the two variables.
    Formula: The equation of the line is typically written as ( y = mx + b ), where:
        ( y ) is the dependent variable (e.g., number of deaths).
        ( x ) is the independent variable (e.g., latitude).
        ( m ) is the slope of the line (how much ( y ) changes for a unit 
            change in ( x )).
        ( b ) is the y-intercept (the value of ( y ) when ( x ) is 0).


    Example from the Video:

        Data: The rate of skin-cancer deaths in US states (y-axis) and the latitude of the state (x-axis).
        Observation: There's a negative correlation; as latitude increases, deaths decrease.
        Regression Line: The line that best fits the data points. In the video, the formula is ( \text{Deaths} = 389 - 6 \times \text{Latitude} ).


How to Use the Regression Line

    Prediction:

        Example: To predict the number of deaths in a state with a latitude of 30:
            Plug 30 into the formula: ( \text{Deaths} = 389 - 6 * 30 ).
            Calculation: ( 389 - 180 = 209 ).
            Result: You'd expect about 209 deaths.


    Interpretation:

        The slope (-6) indicates that for each unit increase in latitude, the number of deaths decreases by 6.
        The y-intercept (389) is the predicted number of deaths when the latitude is 0.


Limitations

    Straight Line: Linear regression can only make predictions along a straight line. It might not capture more complex relationships.
    Beyond the Exam: As you continue your studies, you'll learn more advanced techniques for making predictions that can handle more complex data.


Summary

    Linear regression helps predict one variable based on another.
    Formula: ( y = mx + b ).
    Example: Predicting skin-cancer deaths based on latitude.
    Limitations: Only works for simple linear relationships.
