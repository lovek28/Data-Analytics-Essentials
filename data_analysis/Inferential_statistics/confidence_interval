    Sample Mean (X-bar): The average value from your sample data.
    Population Standard Deviation (σ): A measure of how spread out the values in the population are.
    Sample Size (n): The number of observations in your sample.
    Z-score: A value from a statistical table that corresponds to your desired confidence level (e.g., 95%).

Confidence Interval Formula:
CI = X-bar plus_minum Z(σ/sq.root(n))

 Z-score: A value from the Z-score table that corresponds to the confidence level you want (e.g., 95% confidence level).
Common Z-scores:

    90% confidence level: Z = 1.645
    95% confidence level: Z = 1.960
    99% confidence level: Z = 2.576

In your role, understanding confidence intervals can help you make more informed decisions based on sample data, knowing how much you can trust your estimates.
